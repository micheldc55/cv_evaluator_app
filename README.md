# CV evaluator app

The purpose of this small repo is to have a place where we can quickly and effectively review CVs and add/track comments for each candidate


## Set up with `uv`

Apologies for any confusion in my previous instructions. Given the new information that your uv.lock file is present in version control and youâ€™ve made changes to your pyproject.toml, hereâ€™s the updated process to set up your environment and run your Streamlit app using uv:

Setting Up and Running the CV Evaluator App with uv

### Clone the Repository

If you havenâ€™t already cloned your repository, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micheldc55/cv_evaluator_app.git
cd CV_EVALUATOR_APP
```

You can also do this directly from your IDE of choice by cloning the repository using the url above in the GUI.

### Install uv

If uv isnâ€™t installed on your system, install it using:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Set Up the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

Since the uv.lock file is present, synchronize your environment to match the locked dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command will:
	â€¢	Create a virtual environment (.venv/).
	â€¢	Install all dependencies as specified in the uv.lock file.

Note: If youâ€™ve made changes to the pyproject.toml and need to update the lockfile accordingly, run:

```bash
uv lock
```

Then, synchronize the environment again:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use:

- macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Windows (PowerShell) ðŸ¤®:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```



5. Run the Streamlit App

With the virtual environment activated, start the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Alternative: Run Without Activating the Virtual Environment

If you prefer to run the app without explicitly activating the virtual environment, use:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

This command ensures that streamlit runs within the context of the uv-managed environment.

### Quick reference

For quick reference, execute the following commands in order:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micheldc55/cv_evaluator_app.git
cd CV_EVALUATOR_APP
pip install uv
uv sync
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

Important: Ensure that your pyproject.toml and uv.lock files are up-to-date and consistent. If youâ€™ve added or removed dependencies, always run uv lock followed by uv sync to update the lockfile and synchronize your environment.
